# Survey Money
(Incomplete documentation, will finish later)
APIs of the application: what they do, how they are called, what they return, and any special and security notes

How to set up the environment and initialize the application

What kinds of components there are, and what they do

What kinds of roles users can play, and what they can do
- Anyone with a blockchain address can vote in surveys, but without being a registered user, they can not create any. Survey participants will also receive a reward of ETH for participating in a survey. The amount they receive is determined by the survey owner.
- Registered users can create surveys as well as vote in them (should registered users be allowed to vote in their own surveys?)
- Users can also determine how much ETH they intend to reward participants of their survey.
(Not sure what else to add that would meet this criteria. This seems like enough? The other sections are longer)
